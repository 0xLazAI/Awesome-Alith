A curated list of awesome [Alith](https://alith.lazai.network/docs) agents, resources, libraries, tools and more.

Alith is a decentralized AI agent framework tailored to harness the capabilities of the LazAI -a decentralized AI platform dedicated to building an open, transparent, high-performance, secure, and inclusive AI ecosystem. LazAI solves AI’s data alignment problem with novel technologies, from chaining Data Anchoring Tokens (DATs) to form a blockchain to self-contained iDAOs for entities, enabling composable open networks for AI and Web3 applications. On the LazAI platform, AI developers, data providers, and other stakeholders can collaborate through integrated development tools to jointly create high-quality AI assets. These assets can be used for further development or traded and shared within the platform. LazAI uses blockchain technology to ensure that all interactions are transparent and tamper-proof, with clear ownership and fair profit distribution for contributors.
